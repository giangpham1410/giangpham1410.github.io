								<h2>I. Dataset Summary</h2>
                                    <p>The dataset includes much information about students such as name, batch name, marks, sessions, and their instructors...</p>
                                <h2>II. Dataset</h2>
								<p> The dataset includes 8 tables.</p>
								<ol>
								<li><span class="textbackground">users</span>: name (user name), active (boolean to check if user is active)</li>
								<li><span class="textbackground">batches</span>: name (batch name), active (boolean to check if batch is active)</li>
								<li><span class="textbackground">student_batch_maps</span>: This table is a mapping of the student and his batch. deactivated_at is the time when a student is made inactive in a batch.</li>
								<li><span class="textbackground">instructor_batch_maps</span>: This table is a mapping of the instructor and the batch he has been assigned to take class/session.</li>
								<li><span class="textbackground">sessions</span>: Every day session happens where the teacher takes a session or class of students.</li>
								<li><span class="textbackground">attendances</span>: After session or class happens between teacher and student, attendance is given by student. Students provide ratings to the teacher.</li>
								<li><span class="textbackground">tests</span>: Test is created by instructor. total_mark is the maximum marks for the test.</li>
								<li><span class="textbackground">test_scores</span>: Marks scored by students are added in the test_scores table.</li>
								</ol>

								<h2>V. List of queries</h2>
								<ol>
									<li>Calculate the average rating given by students to each teacher for each session created.
										Also, provide the batch name for which session was conducted.</li>
									<li>Find the attendance percentage for each session for each batch.
										Also mention the batch name and users name who has conduct that session.</li>
									<li>What is the average marks scored by each student in all the tests the student had appeared?</li>
									<li>A student is passed when he scores 40 percent of total marks in a test.
										Find out how many students passed in each test. Also mention the batch name for that test.</li>
									<li>A student can be transferred from one batch to another batch.
										If he is transferred from batch a to batch b. batch b’s active=true and batch a’s active=false in student_batch_maps.
										At a time, one student can be active in one batch only.
										One Student can not be transferred more than four times.
										Calculate each students attendance percentage for all the sessions created for his past batch. Consider only those sessions for which he was active in that past batch.</li>
