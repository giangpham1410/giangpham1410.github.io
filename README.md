## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm Giang, a data analyst.

My background as a Salesforce Administration and Ecommerce Specialist in the BAYA Furniture & Decoration has given me a deep foundation in working with many systems in data collection, analysis, visualization, and coming up with insights and recommendations. 

Iâ€™m self-study and enjoy working with the computer and numbers. At first, I used Excel and then learned more to use other tools like MySQL, Power BI, and Python to analyze data more effectively.
